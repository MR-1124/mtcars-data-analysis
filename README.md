# mtcars-data-analysis
An R project for exploring and analyzing the mtcars dataset

# Data Visualization and Analysis of the Mtcars Dataset

## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project based on the `mtcars` dataset in R. The project explores the relationships between various car attributes, performs statistical analyses, and builds predictive models to understand factors affecting fuel efficiency.

**Features:**

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset by handling outliers and converting categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features like `hp_per_wt` (horsepower per weight).
- **Visualization**:
  - Histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and density plots.
  - Correlation heatmap and 3D scatter plot.
  - Pair plots and advanced visualizations using `ggplot2`.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Correlation analysis, t-tests, and ANOVA.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Linear regression, decision tree, and random forest models to predict `mpg`.
- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - A Shiny app for dynamic exploration of the dataset.
- **Multivariate Analysis**:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to understand data variance.

**How to Use:**

1. **Install R and RStudio** from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
2. **Install Required Packages** by running `install.packages(c("ggplot2", "corrplot", "plotly", "scatterplot3d", "shiny", "rpart", "randomForest", "factoextra"))`.
3. **Run the R Script** to execute data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and model building.

**Shiny App**:
- Launches an interactive dashboard to explore the `mtcars` dataset.

**Insights**:
- Examined the distribution of mpg and its correlation with other attributes.
- Conducted statistical tests and built models to predict fuel efficiency.
- Provided visual and analytical insights into the factors affecting car performance.
